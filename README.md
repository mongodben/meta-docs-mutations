# Meta docs mutations

This repo contains code that takes the MongoDB meta documentation (https://mongodb.com/docs/meta), and transforms it from a MongoDB JSON collection in `meta.pages.json` to a set of markdown files in the `md_docs` directory.

The code to perform this transformation is in the Jupyter notebook `meta_docs_to_md.ipynb`.
