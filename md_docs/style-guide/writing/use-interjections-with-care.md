# Use Interjections with Care

An interjection is an emotional greeting or phrase, usually followed by an exclamation point.

Expressions such as *Hooray!*, *Excuse me!*, *Sorry!*, *No thank you!*, *Oh dear!*, and *Hey, that's mine!* are interjections.

In rare cases, an interjection might be appropriate in technical content.

At the end of a procedure that targets novice users, you might write, "Congratulations! You successfully created your first Atlas cluster."

The tone of an interjection can be condescending. Use them sparingly and with care.
