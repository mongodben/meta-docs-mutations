# Clarify Gerunds and Participles

Participles are verbs that end in *-ed* or *-ing* and act as modifiers. Gerunds are verbs that end in *-ing* and act as nouns. Both types of words are useful and acceptable, but they can cause confusion if they are misplaced in a sentence. For example, the word *meeting* can be a gerund or a participle (or even a noun) depending on its placement in a sentence. When you use gerunds and participles, ensure that the meaning is clear.

</table>The last example illustrates a dangling modifier. In the **Avoid** example, *using* doesn't have a subject, so the implied subject is *address*, which is incorrect. If the implied subject isn't correct, you must revise the sentence to provide a subject for the modifying phrase.

The titles of tutorial or high-level process articles or topics usually start with a gerund. Titles have less context than sentences, so you have to be especially careful to ensure that the meaning is clear.
