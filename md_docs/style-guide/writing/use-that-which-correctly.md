# Use *that*, *which*, and *such as* Correctly

A **restrictive clause** gives meaning to a sentence because it limits the noun to which it refers. If you omit a restrictive clause, you change the meaning of the sentence. You can indicate a restrictive clause with the relative pronoun *that* or *who*, and you don't set off a restrictive clause with commas.

A **nonrestrictive clause** doesn't change the core meaning of the sentence. You set off a nonrestrictive clause with commas and can use the relative pronoun *which* or *who* in some cases.

Make sure to clarify restrictive clauses, as follows:

- Include the relative pronoun (usually *that*). You can identify restrictive clauses in which *that* is missing by looking for two successive nouns.

- Don't substitute *which* for *that*.

- For the use of *such as*, use a comma before a nonrestrictive clause and don't use a comma for a restrictive clause. To tell if the clause is nonrestrictive, remove the phrase starting with *such as* out of the sentence. See whether the sentence remains true.
