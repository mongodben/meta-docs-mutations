# Write Clear and Concise Sentences and Paragraphs

Users can understand wordy and complex writing. They can wade through walls of text, but we shouldn't force them to do that. Use the following guidelines to clarify and condense sentences and paragraphs.

## Use a Consistent Sentence Structure

- As often as possible, use the sentence structure *subject*-*verb*-*object*.

- Use simple declarative sentences for descriptions.

- Use simple imperative sentences for instructions.

- Sentences that describe a condition should always begin with the conditional clause, so that the user can skip the section if the condition does not apply to them.

- Don't make users backtrack to understand a sentence. If they can't understand the beginning of the sentence without reading the end, rewrite the sentence.

<tr>
<td headers="Use">

</td>
<td headers="Avoid">

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Restrict Sentence Length

A well-written long sentence may be hard to follow and understand.

- Try to limit sentences to no more than 20-25 words. Limit to less than 20 words if possible.

- If you must write a longer sentence: - Use more than one clause. - Clarify the relationship between the clauses.

</td>
<td headers="Avoid">
Click the check boxes to confirm whether you would like to Overwrite files with the same name or restore the files to their original folders and then click the Next button.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
### Limit Using *Be* as the Main Verb

Pay special attention if a form of be is the main verb in the sentence. Forms of *be* include:

- *be*

- *is*

- *am*

- *are*

- *was*

- *were*

- *being*

- *been*

Look for a "hidden" verb in the element following the *be*‚Äêverb.

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="Use">
This report analyzes the problem.

</td>
<td headers="Avoid">
This report is an analysis of the problem.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Avoid Expletive Structures

An expletive sentence begins with *It* or *There* and followed by a form of *be*. Consider another noun and verb following the expletive.

<table>

<th id="Use">

</th>
<th id="Avoid">

<tr>
<td headers="Use">

</td>
<td headers="Avoid">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="Use">
Cloud backup has three benefits over legacy backup.

</td>
<td headers="Avoid">

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Avoid Nominalizations

A *nominalization* is a noun derived from a verb. These words often end in -ance, -ence, -ion, or -ment. Identify the verb at the root of the nominalization and use it instead.

<table>
<tr>
<th id="Use">
Use

</th>
<th id="Avoid">

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="Use">
The modal recommends upgrading to new software.

</td>
<td headers="Avoid">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="Use">
It benefits users to have this information.

</td>
<td headers="Avoid">
It would be beneficial to the users if they had this information.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Use the Necessary Words

Business and technical writing isn't creative writing.

- Limit yourself to the words necessary to convey the meaning.

- Remove anything extraneous.

  - Are you using adverbs (modifiers ending in *-ly*)? You can remove most adverbs without changing the meaning.

  - Are you using adjectives? Remove them if they aren't necessary to the meaning. Some features have adjectives in their names. Don't remove those.

  - Can you shorten prepositional phrases?

  - Are you using phrases that don't clarify the content?

- Include all necessary words that clarify the meaning of a sentence.

  - Include all necessary articles (*a*, *an*, *the*), prepositions, connectors, and other syntactic cues, such as those described in Clarify Gerunds and Participles, Use *that*, *which*, and *such as* Correctly, and Clarify Pronouns and Antecedents.

## Create Short Paragraphs

Short paragraphs are easier to scan and understand than longer ones. Use the following guidelines for paragraphs:

- Cover only one idea in each paragraph.

- Limit paragraphs to four to five sentences.

- Avoid having one-sentence paragraphs.

- Use connective or transitional words to ensure flow within and between paragraphs.

- When listing three or more items, use a bullet list instead of embedding the items in a paragraph.

The following examples show how you can break up a long paragraph. Use a list so the user can scan the text.
