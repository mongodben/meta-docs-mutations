# File Types

For references to a file type in text (not code), use one of the following naming conventions, depending on the type of file and the context:

- Generic name, such as an initialization file or a configuration file

- Standard abbreviation, such as a PDF file or an XML file

- File name extension, such as a .zip file

Use a generic name or a standard abbreviation if one exists. If a generic name or a standard abbreviation doesn't exist or isn't appropriate given the context, use the file name extension. The following table provides some common file types and guidelines for referring to them.

For guidelines for formatting file names and extensions, see Text Formatting.
