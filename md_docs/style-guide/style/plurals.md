To form the plural of an abbreviation, an acronym, or a number, add a lowercase *s* without an apostrophe.

If an acronym already represents a plural noun, don't add an *s*.

To refer to more than one FAQ document or section, add the appropriate noun after *FAQ* and make the noun pluralâ€”for example, *FAQ articles*. Follow this guideline for other plural acronyms when you need to refer to more than one instance of them.

Use the singular form or the plural form, use both forms joined by a conjunction, or use the phrase *one or more*.
