# Email Addresses

If you need to show an example email address, use **example.com** or **example.org** as the domain. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) reserves these domains for use in examples.

If you need to show an actual email address, you don't need to format it. RST automatically formats email addresses as a standalone hyperlink.
