# URLs and Domain Names

When including a domain name for an example web site or email address, use the special-use domain name given in section 6.5 of RFC 6761.

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) have reserved the following domains for demonstration and documentation:

```text
*.example
*.example.com
*.example.net
*.example.org
```

The following URLs and email addresses would be acceptable in documentation:

- http://www.example.com/

- http://ldap.example.net/

- http://mongodb.example/

- nimesh@example.org

- liadan@example.net

Never use a customer's or sample customer's URL or email address. Don't invent a fake domain name for this purpose. Even if that name isn't registered today, someone might claim it in the future.
