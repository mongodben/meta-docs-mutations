 Instead, use *app*. The industry trend is toward *app*. It's okay to use *application* as part of a common phrase such as *application programming interface*, but in general usage, *app* is preferable.

</table>Don't hyphenate words that begin with the prefix *bi*, such as *bidirectional* and *bimodal*, unless the root word starts with an *i* or a capital letter.

 *Billion* indicates different numbers in different numeration systems. In the short-scale system (used in the English-speaking countries), it indicates 10 9, or 1,000,000,000. In the long-scale system (used in Spanish-speaking countries), it indicates 10 12, or 1,000,000,000,000.

To avoid confusion when you're citing a large number such as a billion, express the amount in numerals. If space constraints prevent writing numerals, use *billion* as defined in the short-scale system.

**bimonthly**
 Because these terms can be interpreted as *twice a week or month* or *once every two weeks or months*, avoid using them. For clarity, instead use longer terms such as *every two weeks*, *every two months*, *twice a week*, and *twice a month*.

*OS* is a common abbreviation for *operating system* and you can use it without first spelling it out if the context is clear. To form the plural of *OS*, add an *s* without an apostrophe— *OSs*.

However, if you feel that the context makes the use of *OS* or *OSs* confusing in a particular document, spell out the term in all instances in the document. If space is constrained (such as in a table or figure callout), use the abbreviated forms but explain them in text.

If you mean the combination of operating system and hardware configuration, use *platform*.

This term describes a system, item, functionality, or feature that's usable without customization. Don't abbreviate as *OOTB*.
