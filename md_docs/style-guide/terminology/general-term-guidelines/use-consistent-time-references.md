</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="Terms">

</td>
<td headers="Usage">

</td>
<td headers="Examples">

**After** you save your document, you can print it.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="Terms">
following, preceding

</td>
<td headers="Usage">
To locate an item in text or copy

Don't use *above*, *below*, *earlier*, *later*, *before*, or *after* as references to information in text. Where possible, use specific references. If you can't make specific references, use *preceding* and *following* as adjectives for elements such as figures and tables.

<td headers="Examples">
The **preceding** information explains how to print a document correctly.

The utility analyzes the **following** information to prepare the report.

</td>
<td headers="Usage">
To refer to product releases (version numbers).

Don't use *higher*, *lower*, *above*, *below*, *older*, or *newer*.
