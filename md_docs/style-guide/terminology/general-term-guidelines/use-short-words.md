# Use Short, Familiar Words and Phrases

Use short, familiar words and phrases to convey an idea clearly. Such words and phrases are:

- more conversational

- save space

- easier to scan

- often easier for non-native English speakers to understand

Use a longer word or phrase only if necessary to convey a particular meaning.

If a word has variant spellings that are equally acceptable (such as *canceled* and *cancelled*), use the shorter spelling.
