# Task Page Prototype

This page provides general guidance and examples for Information Types. Verify the correct and consistent guidelines for each product with your team.

A task page instructs a user on how to accomplish a particular goal. A task page can be written for users with any level of experience with MongoDB. Users might approach a task for the first time, have limited experience, or need a refresher. A task page should contain all the necessary information for someone to complete the task, any necessary conceptual information, prerequisites, steps, and expected results.

Task page titles begin with a present-tense action verb.

A task page begins with a brief introduction summarizing the task, often called a short description. The short description briefly explains the task, and answers the following questions:

- "What is this task?"

- "What is it used for?"

- "Why do I care?"

This paragraph can include links out to important conceptual information required for this task.

## About this Task

Optional.

Include important conceptual or behavioral information that's directly relevant to the task. If task-related information is extensive, consider a bulleted list that contains brief descriptions of important concepts and links to deeper reading.

## Before you Begin

Optional.

An ordered or unordered list of any prerequisites for the task.

## Steps

These are the steps to complete the task.

In some cases, we recomend that you use a stepped content approach. In others, a single statement and copyable command or syntax example.  In most cases, it's helpful to include an example of what a successful result looks like. It could be a brief description, code block, or screenshot.

### Take an action

Say a little more or provide additional substeps or examples.

Use admonitions sparingly. This note gives critical context or a tip for step completion. It could also include a link to more context or important information.

### Take another action

Say a little more or provide additional substeps or examples.

## Example

Optional.

In some cases, you can work through a specific example throughout the steps. In others, it is helpful to show a complete example at the end. In most cases, it's helpful to include an example of what a successful result looks like. It could be a brief description, code block, or screenshot.

## Next Steps

Optional.

If there is one or many logical next things to do, you can link to them here.

## Learn More

This section appears on every information typed page. It does not replace inline linking, but is intended to augment the information on the page with related concepts, tasks, and reference material. Use it to link related pages that are not already linked above, such as reference information, technical deep dives, less commonly used task pages, or related concepts.
