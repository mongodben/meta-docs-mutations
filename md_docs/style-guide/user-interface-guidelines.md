# User Interface Guidelines

This page needs updated content and examples for MongoDB. Though incomplete, this page contains useful information and should be considered a resource though it is under revision.

Helix is a MongoDB-chartered effort to unify the look, feel, and functionality of MongoDB interfaces.

Helix is one system that includes the following components:

- A design library that includes guidance on text conventions for user interfaces

  The text conventions include the following information:

  - Alert and message guidelines

  - Capitalization

  - Date and time

  - Punctuation

  - Voice and tone

  - Writing guidelines

- A UI toolkit for developers that includes all the component templates for a user interface

You can access all Helix documentation and code, including the Quick Start Guide, the Installation Guide, and the code repository on GitHub, from the Helix landing page.
