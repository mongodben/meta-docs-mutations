# Translation

The original language of all MongoDB documentation is American English. However it is of critical importance to the documentation project to ensure that speakers of other languages can read and understand the documentation.

To this end, the MongoDB Documentation Project is preparing to launch a translation effort to allow the community to help bring the documentation to speakers of other languages.

If you would like to express interest in helping to translate the MongoDB documentation once this project is opened to the public, please:

- complete the MongoDB Contributor Agreement, and

- join the mongodb-translators user group.

The mongodb-translators user group exists to facilitate collaboration between translators and the documentation team at large. You can join the group without signing the Contributor Agreement, but you will not be allowed to contribute translations.
